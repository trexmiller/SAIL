<h2>The Standalone Interface Logger

<h6>The SAIL is an affordable way to expand the capabilities of existing data loggers often used onboard buoys and other aquatic environmental monitoring platforms. We made the SAIL in order to interface our own sensors with data loggers such as the Campbell CR1000 that we have used on environmental monitoring stations. The SAIL board also provides a low cost option for adding SD card logging and GPS.  Data is sent out via RS232.
